- Feature Name: (fill me in with a unique ident, `my_awesome_feature`)
- Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
- RFC PR: [nushell/rfcs#0000](https://github.com/nushell/rfcs/pull/0000)
- Nushell Issue: [nushell/nushell#0000](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/0000)

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in Nu and you were teaching it to another Nu user. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Nu users should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use Nu. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample syntax details like flags and arguments or sample error messages.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to users of other shells.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for plugin architecture), this section should focus on how contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other shells and what experience have their communities had?
- Does this feature exist in comparable programming languages like SQL, that have similar keywords (think select, where)?
- Are there similar features in Nu itself, that can provide guidance on designing this feature?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other shells or programming languages, providing readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other solutions.

Note that while precedent set by other shells is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic way.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
